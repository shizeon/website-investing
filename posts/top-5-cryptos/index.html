Cardano is a smart contract token that is being developed by a team led by a co-creator of Ethereum. In August of this year, the Goguen Mainnet will be released. This upgrade will enable smart contracts on the platform. Cardano already has an established ecosystem, even though we are still this far away from this upgrade. Cardano is a fantastic long term hold, that I&rsquo;d be comfortable holding through a bear market. Overall, it is a great coin to hold and I would definitely recommend you add this to your watch list.</p><h2 id=2-vechain>2) Vechain</h2><p>Vechain is one of the most fundamentally secure coins on the market. Vechain is a supply chain management coin, that is meant for business use. It helps companies and consumers easily identify where the item came from, check it&rsquo;s validity, and much more. It&rsquo;s partnerships alone prove how much Vechain can be worth. These partnerships include BMW, H&M, the Chinese government, and dozens more. While we don&rsquo;t know the extent of these partnerships, it&rsquo;s easy to see that mainstream adoption for Vechain is already starting to take place, and as they get more and more partnerships, I believe the price of Vechain will soar along with it.</p><h2 id=3-polkadot>3) Polkadot</h2><p>Polkadot is very similar to Cardano in the face that they are both smart contract tokens. Polkadot is also created by a co-creator of Ethereum, and they already have smart contracts enabled. I&rsquo;m very bullish on Polkadot for 2021 and the future, due to it&rsquo;s fantastic ecosystem. It stands out among the other smart contract platforms, which is why I&rsquo;m so bullish. Overall, another great coin that has a lot of potential for this year.</p><h2 id=4-theta>4) Theta</h2><p>Theta is a very unique token, in the face that it wants to be a decentralized streaming network. With it&rsquo;s goal to improve the the traditional platforms such as Netflix and Hulu, it&rsquo;s hard to not be bullish on this coin. If that&rsquo;s not enough for you, Theta has around 10 major events/upgrades this year alone. Theta also has it&rsquo;s Mainnet 3.0 coming up on June 30th, which is a massive event for any crypto. Overall, a great coin with a lot of upcoming price catalysts.</p><h2 id=5-chainlink>5) Chainlink</h2><p>Chainlink is similar to Vechain in the way that they are both very fundamentally secure. Chainlink has a massive use case, in it being the major oracle in the smart contract space. Oracles are used to bring outside data to the blockchain. A common example is in a sports betting scenario, the betting odds would change if one team had a large point advantage over another. This is where Chainlink comes in. Chainlink allows these contracts to use information in the outside world. Smart contracts are very static, someone writes them and they don&rsquo;t change, while oracles allow change in the code based on other information. This is a very good token that I see a great ROI on this year, as well as a fantastic long term hold.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://investing-help.com/>&copy; Hangry 2021</a><div></div></div></footer></body></html>
