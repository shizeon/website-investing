A smart contract platform is used to design decentralized contracts. The way this works is they are if-then contracts. For example, if the weather is above 95 degrees out, then send out a heat advisory warning. This is just one example of the many use cases of these. The biggest smart contract platform currently is Ethereum, with a current market cap of 280 billion, as well around 1.2 million transactions per day, while Cardano doesn&rsquo;t even have smart contracts enabled yet. I see such high potential in this coin for a few reasons. First, Cardano&rsquo;s has smart contracts coming in its Goguen Mainnet, which is planned for August. Second, Cardano has significantly lower transaction fees, due to it having an estimated 1,000,000 transactions per second, while Ethereum has only 30 transactions per second. This makes it much cheaper for the people that have built businesses, companies, and other cryptocurrencies on the Cardano network. Third, Cardano has a ERC-20 token converter, that will allow coins from Ethereum to simply and easily move over to the Cardano ecosystem. Fourth, Cardano has a big focus on scalability and sustainability, which Ethereum is having a big problem with. Cardano is tackling these problems by creating their coin in a PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus model, a high amount of transactions per second, and low gas fees. Overall, it&rsquo;s hard to find a reason why someone would want to build upon Ethereum rather than Cardano.</p><h2 id=what-problem-is-it-solving>What Problem Is It Solving?</h2><p>Cardano is solving mainly one big problem with its protocol. First, it has a key emphasis on helping the second and third-world countries (mainly countries in Africa) get connected with the rest of the world. Just recently, Cardano made a deal with Ethiopia, where only around 15% of the population has internet. This deal includes 5 million students using the Cardano platform, and 750,000 teachers. This is huge for both Cardano and Ethiopia, helping them both in huge ways. This is the first public acceptance they&rsquo;ve gotten and may lead to many more partnerships in Africa if this helps Ethiopia.</p><h2 id=the-development-team>The Development Team</h2><p>Cardano is being created by IOHK, a technology and engineering company that builds cryptocurrencies. This company is led by Charles Hoskinson, a co-creator of Ethereum, and the face of Cardano. His goal has always been to help the less fortunate, which seems to be a reason of the split between Vitalik Buterin and Charles Hoskinson, due to Vitalik not having those same immediate goals. Possibly due to this and other reasons, the two split, and this led to Charles having the idea for Cardano. As for the rest of the team, they are all capable developers that have been hand-picked by Charles himself. Cardano is led by a fantastic team with a long-term outlook, which is a big reason for the success I believe Cardano will have.</p><h2 id=upcoming-events-and-news>Upcoming Events and News</h2><p>Cardano currently has had 5 big events planned since its creation. These being Byron, Shelly, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. Byron and Shelly have already been finished, and we are just a couple of months away from Goguen. Each of these upgrades has unique purposes that will each improve Cardano in different ways. As I already touched on, Goguen will bring smart contracts, which is the core function of Cardano. IOHK does have a long-term outlook on this, so they will not rush to complete any of these upgrades, instead of taking their time in building a strong base for Cardano. A lot of people complain about the slow nature of Cardano, but I think this slow-paced style will show its worth in the long term.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://investing-help.com/>&copy; Hangry 2021</a><div></div></div></footer></body></html>
